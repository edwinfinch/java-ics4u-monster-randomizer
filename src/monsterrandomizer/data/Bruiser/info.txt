The Bruiser Demon has both dynamic lights and brightmaps on the main monster,
and unfortunately the dynamic lights tend to cover up the brightmaps. It's up to
the user to decide whether or not they want to keep both, or remove one effect
or the other.


May God have mercy on whoever tries to update this thing's GLDefs...
